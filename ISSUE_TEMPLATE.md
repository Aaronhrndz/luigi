There's currently no strict procedure or guidelines to submitting issues.
Briefuly, just use common sense.

Common sense at least includes:

 * search for similar issues posted before creating a new issue.
 * Use markdown to format all code/logs. Issues which are hard to read
   when rendered on GitHub might be closed with a friendly reminder of this.

Also, if applicacable add steps to reproduce a bug. And feel free to include sample code.
